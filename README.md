# Bootstrap Workshop with Hyper Island

- [Download this project](https://github.com/javve/bootstrap-workshop/archive/master.zip) to get started.
- Open index.html in your favorite editor ([Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is awesome and free)
- What are you wating for?

Each assignment contains a couple of images that shows the desired result. I've decided to no include CSS editing in this workshop, but feel free to add margins under some elements to make it look better.

Questions? Grab me or [ping @javve at Twitter](https://twitter.com/javve).
